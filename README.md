This project reinforces js learning inspired by @dev pro tips channel.

The weather app project is a web application that allows users to retrieve and display weather information for a specific location. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on the user's input.

The main functionality of the app includes:

1. Fetching Weather Data: The app sends an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API, providing the desired location and the API key. It retrieves weather-related information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description for the specified location.

2. Displaying Weather Information: The retrieved weather data is then displayed on the user interface. The app updates various HTML elements with the relevant weather details, including the location name, weather icon, description, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Additionally, it removes any loading indicators and sets a background image related to the location.

3. User Interaction: The app allows users to interact with it in two ways. First, they can enter a location in the search bar and initiate a search by clicking the search button or pressing the Enter key. This triggers the weather data retrieval and display process. Second, users can directly fetch weather data for a predefined location, such as "Madrid," when the app loads.

The purpose of this weather app project is to provide users with an easy and convenient way to access up-to-date weather information for different locations. By leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API and implementing a user-friendly interface, users can quickly obtain weather details and stay informed about the conditions in various areas.
